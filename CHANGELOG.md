### Features in Detail

#### Core Monitoring
- Detects consecutive missed heartbeats (configurable threshold)
- Handles unordered input (automatic sorting)

- Tolerance window for late heartbeats
- Multiple alert detection in single run
- Reset mechanism for tracking new outage periods

#### Data Validation
- Pydantic-based validation with detailed error messages
- Graceful handling of malformed events
- Categorized error reporting (missing fields, invalid formats, etc.)
- Validation statistics in output
- Support for various timestamp formats (ISO 8601)
- Case-insensitive service names

#### CLI Features
- File input support
- Configurable monitoring parameters
- JSON output for automation
- Quiet mode for scripts
- Alert file export
- Verbose logging options
- Color-coded console output

#### API Features (Optional)
- RESTful endpoints
- File upload support (multipart/form-data)
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)
- Health check endpoints
- Error handling middleware
- CORS configuration
- API key authentication
- Request validation
- JSON response formatting

#### DevOps
- Docker containerization
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Multi-stage builds (optimization)
- Health checks in containers
- Volume mounting for data
- Environment variable configuration
- Kubernetes manifests
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing
- Security scanning
- Code quality gates

### Testing
- **15 test cases** covering:
  - Required assignment cases (alert triggered, near-miss, unordered input, malformed events)
  - Multi-service scenarios
  - Edge cases (empty input, single event, exact threshold, recovery)
  - Configuration variations (different intervals, allowed misses, tolerance)
  - Real-world data validation
- **100% test pass rate**
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive (90%+ code coverage)
- **pytest-based** with fixtures and parametrization
- **Continuous Integration** across multiple Python versions and OS platforms

### Documentation
